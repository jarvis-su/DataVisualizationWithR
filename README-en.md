This book  "Beautiful Visualization with R" mainly introduces how to make charts by using R ggplot2 and its extended packages. The first part of it contains the fundamental knowledge of R and data processing related packages of dplyr, tidyr, reshape2 and tidyverse. Also, graphic grammars of base, lattice and ggplot2 were compared.  In the part of 2D chart, specific methods for building diagrams related to distribution, correlation, part-to-whole, change over time by using R ggplot2 and its extended packages are introduced separately.
